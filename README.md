NutriPlant is a web-based application designed to help users identify plant health and provide guidance for plant care. The project features a modern, user-friendly interface with a welcoming splash screen and smooth navigation to the main functionality.

## Features

- **Welcome Page with Loader:** Engages users with a loading animation before entering the main app.
- **Simple Navigation:** After loading, users can proceed to the main application page.
- **Clean, Responsive Design:** The interface is visually appealing and works well on various devices.

## How It Works

1. **Welcome Page:**

3. **Continue to Main App:**  
   After loading, users can click the "Continue" button to go to the main application (`maintrial.html`).
